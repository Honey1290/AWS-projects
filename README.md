Project Title: 
Set Up a Web App Using AWS and VS Code 
Objective: 
The main objective of this project was to set up and deploy a simple web application using 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) and configure it through Visual Studio Code (VS Code) using 
remote SSH connection. This project marks the first step toward building a full DevOps CI/CD 
pipeline. 
Tools and Technologies Used: 
• Amazon Web Services (AWS) – For hosting the web application 
• Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – For development and configuration 
• EC2 Instance – To deploy and run the web server remotely 
• SSH (Secure Shell) – For remote access and file transfer 
• .pem File – For secure authentication 
• Linux Commands – For server setup and configuration 
• Web Browser – To test and verify deployment 
Project Description: 
In this project, I created and deployed a basic web application using AWS EC2 instance and 
configured it through VS Code. 
The process began with launching an EC2 instance on AWS, followed by downloading and 
setting up the .pem key file for secure access. I then connected the EC2 instance with VS Code 
Remote SSH extension to configure and edit files directly on the server. 
The web application was set up by installing and running the required dependencies on the EC2 
instance (for example, a simple HTML or Node.js/Python app). Finally, I verified the setup by 
accessing the public IP of the instance in the browser to confirm that the web app was live.
